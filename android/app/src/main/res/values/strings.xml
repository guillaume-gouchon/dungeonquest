    <string-array name="tutorial_hints">
        <item>Welcome to the Tutorial ! You will learn here how to survive in deadly dungeons.\n\nFirst, learn how to move: each turn, your hero rolls 2 dice for his movement, then the reachable tiles are enlightened in green. Tap on the door to open it and move on to the next room.</item>
        <item>This goblin looks angry, let\'s get rid of him.\n\nA red tile will appear under any monster which is within your attack range. Then you can tap on it to attack it. For each sword you get on the dice when attacking, the target has to roll a shield or lose one health point.</item>
        <item>Good work ! You just made your first frag !\n\nMonsters are not the only threat though; you will also encounter traps. Each turn, your hero will try to detect the traps around him, depending on his number of spirit points, so try not to rush if you want to stay safe ! You can now move on to the next room.</item>
        <item>There is a treasure chest here !\nThe treasure\'s tile is enlightened in blue if you can reach it and open it during your hero\'s turn. Searching for treasures will end your current turn. Move on to the last room when the treasure chest is empty.</item>
        <item>You can now leave this quest by reaching the exit stairs, but before, be sure to remember these last points:\n- You can only exit the dungeon if no monster are visible.\n- Your spells can only be used once a quest, so keep them for the most dangerous monster !</item>
